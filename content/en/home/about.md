I'm the Founder of [Cashey](https://cashey.app).

I have a passion for software development, specifically when it comes to helping people be more productive and happier.

Previously, I have had wide ranging success in other industries. I became a developer after founding my first tech startup, Loyal Loops, and realizing that I needed to learn how to code to communicate effectively with my team and craft the product I envisioned. I am fluent in Go and Javascript among other languages and frameworks. I've been working on differen ttech stacks since 2015 and my goal has always been to create tools and services with an impact.

In this page you will find the projects I’ve worked on, such as my current project Cashey, as well as some of my GitHub repos, blog posts, and some of the talks I’ve given over the years.
